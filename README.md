# BLE Peripheral

## This Repo

This repository contains code for a BLE Peripheral written in MicroPython.  The code is meant for a Raspberry Pi Pico
(RP2) W.  It measures temperature from the on-board sensor and makes it available through BLE, so it can be read or
request notifications.

## Edit and run

This code uses [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) and it is meant to be run in the RP2. I have used VSCode with the
[MicroPico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) extension. If you choose to use this
option (instead of any other editor, like proper Emacs, with
[mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html), or the default
[Thonny](https://thonny.org/)), please run "MicroPico: Configure Project" to run it from the editor.
